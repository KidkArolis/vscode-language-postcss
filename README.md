# language-postcss README

Adds syntax highlighting to PostCSS files in Visual Studio Code.

This is a clone of [PostCSS syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ricard.PostCSS) with minor changes.

The original extension does not have a github repository, so open source collaboration is impossible. This is the main reason I created this clone.
